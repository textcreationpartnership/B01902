            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>

               <hi>THE CASE OF THE <hi>Diſtillers in and about London,</hi>

            <p>IN the twelfth year of King <hi>Charles</hi> the Second, two pence a Gal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lon was laid upon Strong Waters or <hi>Aqua-vitae,</hi> but there was ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver any Duty laid upon Low-wines till the twenty ſecond year of King <hi>Charles,</hi> and then two pence a Gallon was laid for ſix years upon Low-wines made of Wine, or Syder, or other Materials Imported; by reaſon of which Duty laſt mentioned, the Diſtiller could not make the ſame as formerly, ſo that the King had not any advantage thereby, as by the Entries in the Exciſe may appear.</p>
            <p>Low Wines is only a preparation for making of Proof-Spirits or <hi>Aqua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vitae,</hi> and is not ſold nor conſumed in Kind, nor is it fit to be Drank, but is conſtantly Diſtilled into Proof-Spirit or <hi>Aqua-vitae;</hi> and three or four Gallons of Low Wines will make but one Gallon of Proof-Spirit, all the reſt is thrown down the Kennel, not being fit for any uſe.</p>
            <p>In the Firſt Year of the late King <hi>James,</hi> four Pence a Gallon Additional Duty was laid upon Proof-Spirits or <hi>Aquae-vitae,</hi> which makes the Firſt Duty upon it ſix Pence a Gallon; and that Duty was and is ſo heavy upon the Diſtillers, that many have ſunk under it, being a third of the full value of the Proof-Spirit when made, and ſeveral of them are become Priſoners, not being able to advance their Spirits proportionable to ſo great a Duty, which hath hindered the Conſumption of great quantities of courſe Malt, fit only for the Diſtillers uſe.</p>
            <p>If a Duty ſhall be laid upon Low Wines, which is but a preparation for making the Proof-Spirit or <hi>Aqua-vitae,</hi> it will not only hind<gap reason="illegible" extent="2 letters">

               </gap> the Conſumption of many thouſand Quarters of Malt yearly, and the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſumption of Moloſſes and courſe Sugar that comes from their Majeſties Plantations, but alſo Ruine the Diſtiller, and conſequently many hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred Families, and will not Advance their Majeſties Revenue.</p>
            <p>There is a Clauſe mentioned in this Bill, that it ſhall be Lawful for the Officer at all times to enter into the Houſe of any Diſtiller, Retayler or Dealer in any Spirits or <hi>Aqua-vitae,</hi> which Clauſe is Deſtructive to the Diſtillers Trade, for that few Perſons will deal in <hi>Aqua-vitae</hi> or Spirits, if they ſhall be diſturbed at all times in the Night, only for dealing in the ſaid Commodity: And that Clauſe can be of no Advantage to their Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jeſties, becauſe the Maker is only lyable to pay the Duty, as the Brewer is for Beer and Ale; and it was never thought reaſonable to give Power to any Officers to diſturb the Victualer at any time for dealing, in Beer and Ale.</p>
